# PolyglotAssistant

## What's this?
PolyglotAssistant is an opensource toolkit, written in Python 3 Tkinter, for those who learn words of foreign languages. It consists of a vocabulary editor, a book reader, and a vocabulary trainer.

## The first release is coming soon!
Currently the app is in Ukrainian only but I'm translating it to other languages. I'm also planning to release the first version soon. If you are interested, click on "Watch" button to get notification about the latest commits and releases!

## Usage
1) Download/clone this repository.
2) Open its directory in command-line
3) Enter **pip install -r requirements.txt**
4) Run Editor.pyw (vocabulary editor), ReadIt.pyw (all-in-one book reader with translator and vocaulary editor) or Trainer.pyw (to train words from an existing vocabulary).
5) Enjoy! :)

Note: It's recommended to do these actions in a virtual environment, though it is not necessary.
