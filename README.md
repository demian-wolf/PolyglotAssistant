# LearnWords
LearnWords is an open-source software, that allows you to learn words of foreign languages. It consists of a learning plan editor and a learning plan trainer.
### How does it works?
###### 1. You add some words you want to train into the Editor. This application hasn't got an internal dict, so you can learn any words and translations of any language.
###### 2. You can edit these words, remove some or clear the whole words' list and then save this as a LearnWords learning plan file (.lwp). Note you can also open an existing learning plan and correct it.
###### 3. Then you can train the words using Trainer. You can open the learning plan from Editor or directly from Trainer home window. It will automatically analyze the words you know and the words you don't know. Trainer will keep statistics on the words, and will train the words you know worse more, than you know better.
###### 4. I hope, LearnWords will help you to learn your foreign language)
